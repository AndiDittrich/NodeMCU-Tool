Requirements
------------

To use/install the NodeMCU-Tool, you have to prepare your system to match the following requirements. Especially as beginner, you should read this part **carefully**

### NodeMCU Serial Driver ###

Depending on your Module-Type you have to install the platform-specific driver for the usb-serial-interface. 
The original NodeMCU v0.9 comes with a CH341 chip with may requires manual driver installation. Modern versions like 1.0 use a CP210x chip with work out of the box on most common systems.
Other ESP8266 platforms may user other interfaces - please refer to their user manuals!

### Node.js ###

The NodeMCU-Tool is written in javascript and requires [Node.js >= 7.6](https://nodejs.org) as runtime environment. And please don't worry about the wording - NodeMCU and Node.js are two **complete different** things!

**!! There is currently an issue with Node.js 11 on Windows 10 platforms. Please use Node.js 10 LTS !!**

In case you're not familiar with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) it's recommended to read some [basic introductions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) first!
Please [download the Node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install on your system in case it's not already there.

---------------------------------------

Installation
------------

Thanks to Node.js, the NodeMCU-Tool is platform independent and will run on Windows, Linux und OSX. There are different installation variants available (system wide or project based). 

### via NPM (Node.js Package Manager) ###

It's recommended to install nodemcu-tool as [global package](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally).
NPM will register the binary automatically in your path - it will be directly available on the command line.

#### Global Installation as root (Linux/Mac OS Platforms) ####

The global installation may require administrator(root) privileges because the package is added to the systems library path. If you get any permission errors on Linux/Mac OS run the command as root or via `sudo`.

> **Note:** In some special cases the installation may fail with some errors related to `node-serialport` or `node-gyp`. This errors are caused by missing pre-build binaries (native code/drivers for your platform matching your OS/nodejs version) - therefore they have to compiled on your machine!
> To resolve such issues, add the `--unsafe-perm` flag to the following command - it allows the build scripts to be executed as root.

```shell
$ sudo npm install nodemcu-tool -g
```

#### Global Installation (Windows Platforms) ####

```shell
$ npm install nodemcu-tool -g
```

#### Local/Project related Installation ####

You can also install it in your local project directory. When using this method, the `nodemcu-tool` command is **not registered** within your path!

```shell
$ npm install nodemcu-tool
```

In this case, a link to the binary file is located in `node_modules/.bin/nodemcu-tool`

### As Archive from GitHub ###

You can also download the [latest release](https://github.com/AndiDittrich/NodeMCU-Tool/releases/latest) directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/AndiDittrich/NodeMCU-Tool/releases) and extract the sources to your project directory.
After downloading you have to **install the dependencies** by running `npm install` in the nodemcu-tool directory.

When using this method, the `nodemcu-tool` command is **not registered** within your path. You have to register it manually using a symlink - or the recommended way: call the binary file `./bin/nodemcu-tool.js` directly.

---------------------------------------

First Steps
-----------

### 1. The Location of the binary file ###

After installing **NodeMCU-Tool** you should open a **new** terminal window and check if the tool is working by obtaining the current version. It should output the current semantic-version tag.
Depending on your installation type (global ==> file is registered into your path) you can use the tool directly or you have to go into the module directory:

#### For Global Installations (Win/Linux/OSX) ####

The binary file is registered within your path. This tutorial assumes that you have installed the tool globally. Otherwise you have to modify the program-call as described below.

```bash
$ nodemcu-tool --version
1.5.0
```

#### For Local Installations ####

This means you have installed nodemcu-tool via NPM **without** the `-g` (global) flag or via the `.zip` / `.tar` package.
There will be **no** global shortcut to the nodemcu-tool binary! The binary is located in `node_modules/nodemcu-tool/bin/nodemcu-tool.js`

##### Linux, OSX #####

```bash
$ cd node_modules/nodemcu-tool/bin
$ ./nodemcu-tool.js --version
1.5.0
```

##### Windows #####

You have to call the node.exe runtime in your command!

```bash
$ cd node_modules/nodemcu-tool/bin
$ node nodemcu-tool.js --version
1.5.0
```

### 2. Identify Your NodeMCU Device ###

Now you can connect the NodeMCU Module to your computer. The module will be accessible via a virtual serial port. You can identify the port by using the `devices` command.
In this example, it is connected via `/dev/ttyUSB0`. Keep in mind that you have to provide the device-name to NodeMCU-Tool on each command!

```shell
./nodemcu-tool devices
[NodeMCU] Connected Devices | Total: 1
          |- /dev/ttyUSB0 (Silicon_Labs, usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_0001-if00-port0)
```

### 3. Create the initial File System ###
This will remove all existing files on the module but is required when running the module **for the first time**. You can skip this step in case you've already done that manually!

```shell
$ nodemcu-tool mkfs --port=/dev/ttyUSB0
[NodeMCU-Tool] Do you really want to format the filesystem and delete all file ? (no) yes
[NodeMCU-Tool] Connected
[NodeMCU] Version: 0.9.5 | ChipID: 0xd1aa | FlashID: 0x1640e0
[NodeMCU] Formatting the file system...this will take around ~30s
[NodeMCU] File System created | format done.
```

### 4. Upload a new File ###

**Hint** include the native [encoder Module](http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/modules/encoder/) into your firmware to speed-up the uploading by factor 4..10!

```shell
$ nodemcu-tool upload --port=/dev/ttyUSB0 helloworld.lua
[NodeMCU-Tool] Connected
[NodeMCU] Version: 0.9.5 | ChipID: 0xd1aa | FlashID: 0x1640e0
[NodeMCU-Tool] Uploading "main.lua" ...
[NodeMCU-Tool] Data Transfer complete!
```

### 5. Run It directly and view the output ###

```shell
$ nodemcu-tool run helloworld.lua
[NodeMCU-Tool] Connected
[NodeMCU] Version: 0.9.5 | ChipID: 0xd1aa | FlashID: 0x1640e0
[NodeMCU] Running "helloworld.lua"
>----------------------------->
Hello World!
YEAH!!! HELLO WORLD!!!
String: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr
>----------------------------->
```

### Available Commands ###

All commands a well documented within the [Command Reference](docs/CommandReference.md)

Project based configuration
---------------------------

In case you're using different serial port or the baudrate-settings, it's possible to create a configuration file with specific settings for your project.
To initially create the configuration file, use the `init` command:

```shell
$ nodemcu-tool init
[NodeMCU-Tool] Creating project based configuration file..
[NodeMCU-Tool] Baudrate in Bit per Seconds, e.g. 9600 (default) (9600) 9600
[NodeMCU-Tool] Serial connection to use, e.g. COM1 or /dev/ttyUSB2 (/dev/ttyUSB0) COM3
```

This will create a JSON based configuration file named `.nodemcutool` in your **current directory** - you can edit this file manually

### Example Configuration ###

In this Example, the baudrate is changed to 19.2k and COM3 is selected as default port. Additionally the `--minify` and `--compile` flags are set permanently.

```json
{
    "baudrate": "19200",
    "port": "COM3",
    "connectionDelay": 100,
    "compile": true,
    "minify": true,
    "keeppath": true
}
```
 
### Configuration Keys ###

All configuration options are **optional**

* **baudrate** (int) - the default baudrate in bits per second
* **port** (string) - the comport to use
* **connectionDelay** (int) - connection-delay in ms
* **compile** (boolean) - compile lua files after upload
* **minify** (boolean) - minifies files before uploading
* **keeppath** (boolean) - keep the relative file path in the destination filename (i.e: static/test.html will be named static/test.html)
  
### Notes ###
  
* NodeMCU-Tool will only search in the **current directory** for the `.nodemcutool` file!
* All default options can be overwritten by using the command line options
* The `.nodemcutool` file is only recognized in `CLI Mode` **NOT** in `API Mode`

Programmatic Usage and Low Level API
------------------------------------
It's possible to use the underlying "NodeMcuConnector" in your own projects to communicate with a NodeMCU based device.
Or you can call the `bin` file with an external tool. For more details, take a look into the [Programmatic Usage Guide](docs/ProgrammaticUsage.md)
